1. At this point in the semester, we have been through quite a bit of material and in the process, I have been able to learn a good variety of the key concepts associated with content management.  
2. This week, we learned alot about content management systems and their definitions as written by Barker. Now, I believe that I can describe and compare content management systems. 
3. We have learned how best to manage workflows by utilising group roles to increase efficiency. I was also introduced to the Kanban workflow system which I tried out this past weekend to arrange all my assignments and I really enjoyed using it as it made working and studying easier for me because it had everything I needed to do at that time laid out for me. 
4. We have gotten our hands on Micrsofot teams. So far, I have enjoyed using it and we have set up a channel for our group work so we have a platform to communicate and exchange information. 
5. We have been introduced to a few resources like the Web Content Management Glossary which has tons of useful information that make working with CMS easier because you understand all the key concepts.
