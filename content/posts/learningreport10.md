1. At this point in the semester, we have been through quite a bit of material and in the process, I have been able to learn a good variety of the key concepts associated with content management.  
2. Since the beginning of the semester, we have learned alot about content management systems and their definitions as written by Barker. Now, I believe that I can describe and compare content management systems. For module 10, we learned abput content modeling and why it is important to the cohesion of a document. We learned about the various sub categoriues related to content modelling like content type and data type.
3. We have learned how best to manage workflows by utilising group roles to increase efficiency. I was also introduced to the Kanban workflow system which have been using ever since I was told about it to arrange all my assignments which makes working and studying easier for me because it has everything I need to do at any given time laid out for me. 
4. We have gotten our hands on Micrsofot teams. So far, I have enjoyed using it and we have set up a channel for our group work so we have a platform to communicate and exchange information. 
5. We have been introduced to a few resources like the Web Content Management Glossary which has tons of useful information that make working with CMS easier because you understand all the key concepts.
