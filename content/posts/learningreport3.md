1. We have started discussing key terms about content management and what is considered as content or not. This gfollowing week, we discussed roles and how we can apply those roles to ensure succes in our group activities.
2. So far, we have gotten our hands on Netlify and Github. I didn't know it how easy it is to create a website until this assignment gave me opportunity to create one myself. 
3. We have learned how best to manage workflows by utilising group roles to increase efficiency. This because it makes the work easier and faster becuase everyone knows what they're supposed to do.
4. We have gotten our hands on Micrsofot teams. So far, I have enjoyed using it. It has a lot of useful features.
5. We have been introduced to a few resources like the Web Content Management Glossary which has tons of useful information that make working with CMS easier because you understand all the key concepts.
